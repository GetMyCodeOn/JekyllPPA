Our tiny dragons class are designed to create a fun and enjoyable environment for children to learn without undue pressure to achieve.

The main objectives of this programme are to develop motor skills such as coordination, balance, agility and proprioceptive skills and understanding.

The behavioural principles of martial arts are also implemented in class to help improve discipline and focus.

At this stage we are aware that each child is different and develops at different rates, we assess each child on an individual basis and tailor the programme to suit their needs and abilities.
