Our Junior and adult programme focus on developing self-esteem and positive-self image. An emphasis on improving physical fitness alongside learning and knowing when and how to implement self-defence techniques is more intense than our other programmes. However we do understand that each member is different from each other and may have different levels of fitness and experience. Rest assured you will be moving at a pace that is comfortable to you and gradually build into more challenging situations and scenarios.
